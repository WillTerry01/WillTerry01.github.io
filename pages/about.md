## About

Hi, I’m **{{ site.author.name }}** 👋  

I recently completed my **Master’s in Robotics and AI at UCL**, where I focused on practical applications of autonomous systems and perception. Throughout my studies, I spent countless hours developing the robotics projects showcased in the **Uni Projects** tab — each one an opportunity to combine creativity with technical depth.  

To stay active in the field, I’ve been working part-time as a **Teaching Assistant** for an embedded systems course at UCL, helping students program STM32 microcontrollers and integrate various sensors. This experience has deepened my understanding of hardware–software interaction and reinforced my passion for hands-on engineering.  

I’m now eager to **launch my career in Robotics and SLAM**, and I’m actively pursuing opportunities where I can contribute to innovative, real-world systems.  


Outside of robotics, I enjoy experimenting with creative projects (see the **Projects** tab), **cooking**, and **staying active**. I previously worked as a cook, which taught me patience, timing, and precision — skills that surprisingly align well with robotics! I’m also an avid **gamer and tinkerer**, often setting up custom servers for **Minecraft** and **Terraria** on repurposed Linux machines for friends. 😄
