# ChatGPI API - Auto Content

The Auto Content project was a creative experiment using **ChatGPT's API** to explore its capabilities. My goal was to combine multiple GPT tools—text generation, text-to-speech (TTS), and image creation—into a cohesive script. The idea was to generate a children’s book by using a template prompt and random objects to craft a story. The generated script would then be split into multiple sections, stored in an array, and processed iteratively. Each section would utilize GPT's TTS model to create narration and the image generation tool to produce corresponding visuals.

Although I successfully implemented the individual components, I didn’t complete the project by fully integrating and compiling them into a final product. If you'd like to explore this project further, you can find it on my GitHub here:
