# This Website

Initially, I wanted to experiment with creating a website using a Raspberry Pi or an ESP32. However, after some research, I discovered potential security risks with the ESP32, and I decided to explore other projects with my Raspberry Pi, which you can find elsewhere on this site.

Ultimately, I concluded that using a hosted service to build the website would be the best option. After exploring various "build-your-own-website" platforms, I found them unsatisfactory and decided to create the website myself.

GitHub Pages turned out to be the perfect solution. Despite not being a front-end developer, I saw this as an opportunity to experiment and learn. To assist with the process, I used Curser, a powerful IDE that leverages large language models (LLMs). Curser's ability to access project files and provide context-based assistance made writing code much easier.

Even though I had no prior experience with CSS or HTML, I successfully created a website I’m proud of. This project taught me a lot about the development process, but I hope it’s the last website I ever build—CSS is not a skill I’m particularly keen to master! Moving forward, I plan to focus my time on other, more technical projects.
