# The Arduino Project

The Arduino Smart Greenhouse project served as an introduction to coding in C and using an Arduino to control environmental conditions in a greenhouse. While the project did not involve building the greenhouse itself, it focused heavily on programming and electronics, resulting in a system with several key features:

    - Temperature Monitoring and Control: Adjustable range settings to maintain optimal conditions.
    - Humidity Measurement and Regulation: Keeps humidity within user-defined thresholds.
    - Light Intensity Detection: Allows customizable target levels for lighting.
    - LCD Display: Provides real-time sensor readings for temperature, humidity, and light intensity.
    - Analog Stick Interface: Simplifies the adjustment of environmental parameters.

The system also included a built-in alert system: a buzzer would sound if any environmental conditions—temperature, humidity, or light—were out of range. All relevant data was displayed in real time on the LCD screen, providing easy monitoring.

This project was a fun and practical introduction to Arduino, offering hands-on experience with sensors, coding, and electronics. I’d highly recommend it to anyone looking to get started with Arduino!
