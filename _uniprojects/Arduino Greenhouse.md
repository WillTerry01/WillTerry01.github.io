# Smart Greenhouse

This project introduced me to **embedded programming in C** and **hardware control with Arduino**, focusing on creating an automated greenhouse monitoring system.  
While we didn’t construct the physical greenhouse, the emphasis was on developing reliable **sensor integration**, **control logic**, and **user interaction** through hardware.

### 🌱 System Features

- **Temperature Monitoring & Control:** Adjustable temperature thresholds to maintain ideal conditions.  
- **Humidity Measurement & Regulation:** Automatic responses to keep humidity within user-defined limits.  
- **Light Intensity Detection:** Adjustable light targets to simulate different growing environments.  
- **LCD Display:** Real-time readings of temperature, humidity, and light intensity.  
- **Analog Stick Interface:** Simple, intuitive way to modify system parameters.  
- **Buzzer Alert System:** Audible warning when environmental conditions move out of range.

### ⚙️ Implementation Details

The system continuously read sensor inputs and adjusted actuators to maintain balance within set thresholds.  
All readings were displayed live on the LCD, allowing for quick feedback and system tuning.  
A **buzzer alarm** provided a failsafe alert whenever conditions exceeded safe ranges.

This project deepened my understanding of **sensor calibration**, **PWM control**, **real-time monitoring**, and **embedded system design**.
